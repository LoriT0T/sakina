/**
 * Track assembly, in the browser.
 *
 * The original pipeline assembled with ffmpeg in a server process. That cannot be hosted:
 * serverless platforms have neither an ffmpeg binary nor a function budget that survives a
 * four-minute render. Doing it here also means the listener's script and finished audio
 * never touch a disk we control, which is what the local-first promise was always claiming.
 *
 * Equivalences and one honest downgrade, versus the ffmpeg chain:
 *   highpass 80 Hz              → BiquadFilter highpass, identical intent
 *   lowpass 10 kHz              → BiquadFilter lowpass, identical intent
 *   deesser                     → fixed high-shelf cut at 6.5 kHz. This is the downgrade:
 *                                 a shelf is static where a de-esser is dynamic. It removes
 *                                 the same sibilant band but also takes a little air out of
 *                                 everything else. At this level, into a dark room, that is
 *                                 the right trade — sibilance is what jolts people awake.
 *   loudnorm -23 LUFS           → BS.1770 gated measurement here + a single exact gain
 *   afade / volume taper        → sample-accurate gain curves applied directly

  // after the fourth at the loudest of the opening minutes, and apply the correction as a
