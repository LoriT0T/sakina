other forms — "I have…", "I am someone who…", "I can…", "I'm able to…", "It feels…", "I trust…".

};

const SCRIPTING_RULES = `═══ THE STYLE. This is the part that matters most. ═══

Write in the voice of a first-person affirmation track: the listener describing their life as it
already is. Measured from the reference tracks they gave: median nine words a line, first person
throughout, present tense throughout, gratitude the densest single marker.

═══ RULE 1 — EVERY LINE IS AN AFFIRMATION ═══

There is no guided relaxation in this track. Not one line.

  ✗ NEVER write body sensations or relaxation instructions. No jaw, shoulders, arms, hands,
    chest, stomach, hips, legs, feet, breath, muscles. Nothing sinking, softening, relaxing,
    loosening, growing heavy, settling or resting.
  ✗ NEVER write scene-setting or free-floating imagery. A line that paints a picture without
    asserting something about the listener is not an affirmation. "Cold steel on my palms",
    "chrome catching the afternoon sun", "the bar feels light and the rubber feels thick" — all
    forbidden. They are broad, they are about nothing, and they are not wanted.
  ✓ EVERY line contains a first-person subject: "I", "I'm", "I've" or "me" — not merely "my".
    The one exception is an "It feels…" line, which is a statement about how their life feels.

═══ RULE 2 — SAY EACH AFFIRMATION TWO OR THREE TIMES ═══

Do not write a list of separate affirmations. Write a small number of affirmations, each stated
TWO OR THREE TIMES IN A ROW, and mark each group with the same "cluster" number.

Each restatement says the same thing again, slightly differently — a shade more specific, or
naming what it gives them. Not a synonym swap; a deepening.

  cluster 1: I'm so grateful that I train four times a week.
  cluster 1: I'm so grateful that four times a week is just what I do now.
  cluster 1: I'm so grateful that showing up stopped being a decision.

  cluster 2: I have the strength to finish the last hard set.
  cluster 2: I have the strength to stay under the bar when it burns.

Three restatements for the important goals, two for the rest.

═══ RULE 3 — EVERY LINE IS ABOUT THIS LISTENER ═══

Use their own words, their own goals, their own evidence, their own obstacle. A line that could
appear in anyone's affirmation track is a failed line. No generic encouragement.

═══ THE FORMS, and the label to give each line ═══
  gratitude    "I'm so grateful that…" / "I'm really grateful for…"   ← use most
  having       "I have…"                — the thing, already had
  identity     "I am someone who…" / "I am a…"
  capability   "I can…" / "I'm able to…"
  feeling      "It feels…" / "I feel…"  — name what the state gives them
  reciprocity  what they are to their people; who can depend on them
  trust        "I trust…" — short breathers
  evidence     something real they told you, spoken in the present

═══ ALSO BANNED ═══
  • Second person: no "you", "your", "yourself".
  • Future tense: no "I will", "I'll", "one day", "someday".
  • Process hedging: no "I am learning to", "I am trying to", "little by little".
  • Universe / manifest / abundance / vibration / attract / law of attraction / divine /
    prosperity / millionaire. The reference tracks contain NONE of this vocabulary.
  • Exclamation marks. Question marks. Interrogative phrasing.
  • Hype and motivational-speaker cadence.

Money, the body's strength and possessions are fair subjects — spoken plainly and concretely as
earned, present and used, never metaphysically, and always as something the listener HAS or IS,
never as a picture of an object.

Nine words is the target length. Fourteen is the ceiling.`;

const PROCESS_RULES = `═══ THE RULES. These are not style preferences; they come from the research. ═══

BANNED, without exception:
  • Absolute trait claims the listener will silently contradict. "I am confident."
    "I am successful." "I am free from all cravings." Repeating an unbelievable statement
    measurably LOWERS mood in people who do not already believe it. This is the single most
    important rule.
  • Any wealth, manifestation, universe, cosmic, energy, destiny or mystical framing.
  • Superlatives and absolutes: always, never, completely, totally, perfectly, forever,
    unlimited, no matter what, nothing can stop.
  • Second person. No "you", "your", "yourself". Everything is first person, singular.
  • Exclamation marks. Question marks. Any interrogative phrasing at all ("Will I…", "Am I…").
  • Any line the listener could answer with "no I'm not".

THE PATTERNS. Every line is exactly one of these, and you will label it:
  process      "I am learning to…", "I am building…". Growth underway, never claimed as done.
  evidence     Anchored to something real they told you above, using their actual detail.
  compassion   "I can be kind to myself about this." Makes no claim that can be contradicted.
  values       Affirms what they care about rather than a trait they lack.
  intention    "When <specific cue>, I <specific action>." MUST contain a concrete when/if cue.
               Strongest evidence of anything here (d = 0.65).
  ambivalence  "Part of me resists this, and that part is welcome here too." Protective.
  sensory      "My chest is loose. My jaw is soft." Body-anchored, aids sleep onset.

VOICE: short sentences, every one falling at the end. Plain and sincere. No therapist lilt, no
poetry, no metaphor-stacking, no "journey", "embrace", "radiant", "flow". Contractions fine.
No stage directions, no bracketed tags, no numbering inside the text.`;
