 * Style direction for the TTS model.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (docs/GEMINI-TTS.md §7): an earlier draft of this preamble was rejected by
 * the API with HTTP 400 `content_blocked`. The blocked wording described the *listener's*
 * state ("as if speaking to someone already half asleep", "you do not have to stay awake
 * for this") which reads as hypnotic induction. This version describes **vocal delivery
 * only** and never refers to the listener's consciousness. Re-test against the live API
 * before changing a single clause of BASE_STYLE.
 *
 * BASE_STYLE is byte-identical on every chunk of a track so the voice does not drift
 * across request boundaries. SECTION_STYLE adds at most one short clause, which is the
 * minimum needed to make energy descend across the hour without destabilising continuity.
